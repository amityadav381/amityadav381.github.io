## I tried making my device #1

The project was to make a device with following features:
1. Audio recording for journaling.
2. Setting reminders and alarms via speech.
3. Has a speech recognition model running locally, completely offline. 
   1. For transcribing stuff.
   2. Fast retrieval of  a particular journal/reminder/task.
   3. For privacy  
4. Small enough to carry in your pocket. like a car key.
